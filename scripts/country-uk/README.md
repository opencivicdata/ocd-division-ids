The UK mapping and place naming agency is called the [Ordnance Survey](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/). They release much of thier data with open licenses as shapefiles, including a set of all electoral jurisdictions available [here](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/opendatadownload/products.html#BDLINE).

The wiki articles [Administrative Geography of the United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_geography_of_the_United_Kingdom) and [Subdivisions of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdivisions_of_England) are helpful.

The electoral data contains the following sub types, for additional information see the [Ordnance Survey administrative geography and civil voting area ontology](http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/ontology/admingeo/).
