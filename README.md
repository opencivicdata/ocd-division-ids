# Open Civic Data Division Identifiers (OCD-ID)

The goal of this project is to assign somewhat predictable and globally unique identifiers to political divisions.

The canonical documentation of OCD-IDs is expressed as [OCDEP 2: Open Civic Data Divisions](https://github.com/opencivicdata/docs.opencivicdata.org/blob/master/proposals/0002.rst).

Tests can be run with [Bazel](https://bazel.build/):

```
$ bazel test :all --test_output=errors
```
